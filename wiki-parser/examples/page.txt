During the time period between 2006 and 2009, Rust was not publicized to others at Mozilla and was written in Hoare's free time; Hoare began speaking about the language around 2009 after a small group at Mozilla became interested in the project. Hoare cited languages from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s as influences — including CLU, BETA, Mesa, NIL, Erlang, Newsqueak, Napier, Hermes, Sather, Alef, and Limbo. He described the language as \"technology from the past come to save the future from itself.\" Early Rust developer Manish Goregaokar similarly described Rust as being based on \"mostly decades-old research.\"",

The first drivers written in Rust were included in version 6.8. In 2025, kernel developers at the Linux Kernel Developers Summit determined the project to be a success, and Rust usage for kernel code will no longer be considered experimental. The Android developers used Rust in 2021 to rewrite existing components. Microsoft has rewritten parts of Windows in Rust. The r9 project aims to re-implement Plan 9 from Bell Labs in Rust. Rust has also been used in the development of new operating systems such as Redox, a \"Unix-like\" operating system and microkernel, Theseus, an experimental operating system with modular state management, and most of Fuchsia. Rust is used for command-line tools and operating system components such as stratisd, a file system manager and COSMIC, a desktop environment by System76.",
